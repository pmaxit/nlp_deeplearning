{"name":"len_us-first-names-database","title":"US First Names Database","description":"Common first and last names\n\n**First Names Data Source**\nAll names are from Social Security card applications for births that occurred in the United States after 1879. Note that many people born before 1937 never applied for a Social Security card, so their names are not included in our data. For others who did apply, our records may not show the place of birth, and again their names are not included in our data.\n\nAll data are from a 100% sample of our records on Social Security card applications as of the end of February 2016.\nlink to popular baby names via a baby picture\n\n**Data qualifications**\nPeople using our data on popular names are urged to explicitly acknowledge the following qualifications.\n\n    1. Names are restricted to cases where the year of birth, sex, State of birth (50 States and District of Columbia) are on record, and where the given name is at least 2 characters long.\n    2. Name data are not edited. For example, the sex associated with a name may be incorrect. Entries such as \"Unknown\" and \"Baby\" are not removed from the lists.\n    3. Different spellings of similar names are not combined. For example, the names Caitlin, Caitlyn, Kaitlin, Kaitlyn, Kaitlynn, Katelyn, and Katelynn are considered separate names and each has its own rank.\n    4. When two different names are tied with the same frequency for a given year of birth, we break the tie by assigning rank in alphabetical order.\n    5. Some names are applied to both males and females (for example, Micah). Our rankings are done by sex, so that a name such as Micah will have a different rank for males as compared to females. When you seek the popularity of a specific name (see \"Popularity of a Name\"), you can specify the sex. If you do not specify the sex, we provide rankings for the more popular name-sex combination.\n\nAs an exception to the restriction that births be in the United States, we provide popular names for births in U. S. territories. The data on births in U. S. territories are not included in our national data. \n\nSource: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html\n\n**Last Names Data Source**\nThis data was gathered from almost 270 million name responses from the 2000 Census, and then tabulated to include only the surnames that occurred 100 or more times.\n\n```\nField           Description\n-----           -----------\n\nname            Last name\nrank            Rank\ncount           Number of occurrences\nprop100k        Proportion per 100,000 people for name\ncum_prop100k    Cumulative proportion per 100,000 people\npctwhite        % Non-Hispanic White Only\npctblack        % Non-Hispanic Black Only\npctapi          % Non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander Only\npctaian         % Non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaskan Native Only\npct2prace       % Non-Hispanic of Two or More Races\npcthispanic     % Hispanic Origin\n```\n\nSource: http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html","homepage":"https://data.world/len/us-first-names-database","resources":[{"name":"common_surnames_census_2000","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"name","title":"name","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"name"},{"name":"rank","title":"rank","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"rank"},{"name":"count","title":"count","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"count"},{"name":"prop100k","title":"prop100k","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"prop100k"},{"name":"cum_prop100k","title":"cum_prop100k","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"cum_prop100k"},{"name":"pctwhite","title":"pctwhite","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pctwhite"},{"name":"pctblack","title":"pctblack","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pctblack"},{"name":"pctapi","title":"pctapi","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pctapi"},{"name":"pctaian","title":"pctaian","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pctaian"},{"name":"pct2prace","title":"pct2prace","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pct2prace"},{"name":"pcthispanic","title":"pcthispanic","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"pcthispanic"}]},"path":"data/common_surnames_census_2000.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"ssa_names_db","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"name","title":"Name","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"name"},{"name":"gender","title":"Gender","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"gender"},{"name":"frequency","title":"Frequency","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"frequency"},{"name":"include","title":"Include?","type":"boolean","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","dwSourceId":"include"}]},"path":"data/ssa_names_db.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"original/Common_Surnames_Census_2000.csv","path":"original/Common_Surnames_Census_2000.csv","format":"csv","mediatype":"text/csv","bytes":9346026},{"name":"original/SSA_Names_DB.xlsx","path":"original/SSA_Names_DB.xlsx","format":"xlsx","mediatype":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","bytes":827508}],"keywords":["names","social security","contributors wanted"]}
